# Graphood Starter Template

A flexible, production-ready Next.js multi-tenant starter template designed for seamless integration with **Graphood API v1**. 

This template provides a robust foundation for developers to quickly build and deploy multi-tenant applications connected to the Graphood platform with built-in server-side tenant resolution and React Query setup.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Multi-Tenant Architecture:** Automatically detects and resolves tenants on the server side via subdomains or development sandboxes.
* **Next.js (App Router):** Built with the latest Next.js features, Server Components, and layouts.
* **API Integration Ready:** Pre-configured with secure API headers and authenticated calls to Graphood API v1.
* **State & Data Management:** Integrated with React Query providers out of the box.
* **Developer Friendly:** Clean project structure, TypeScript support, and strict type safety.

## 🛠️ Quick Start

Follow these steps to get your project up and running locally:

### 1. Clone the repository
\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/abdelraman-mohamed34/graphood-starter-template.git
cd graphood-starter-template
\`\`\`

### 2. Install dependencies
\`\`\`bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
\`\`\`

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory by copying the configuration variables. You can use the sandbox defaults for local testing:

\`\`\`env
GRAPHOOD_SERVER_BASE_URL=https://graphood-5x58.vercel.app
GRAPHOOD_SERVER_API_KEY=sk_test_sandbox
\`\`\`

### 4. Run the development server
\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
\`\`\`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

For a tenant subdomain on the same machine, open `http://sandbox.localhost:3000`.
To test from another device, start Next.js with `npm run dev -- --hostname 0.0.0.0`
and open `http://<YOUR-LAN-IP>:3000`. `localhost` always points to the device that
opens the URL, so `sandbox.localhost` cannot address your development computer from
another phone or computer. Add a LAN DNS/hosts entry if you specifically need a
subdomain while testing across devices.

## Suty site editor test

Open `/site-editor-test?tenantSlug=sandbox` (or use the tenant input). The test editor keeps the Graphood API key on the server and proxies load, draft, and publish calls through `/api/site-editor`.

Configure the documented Graphood paths with these server-only variables before using the API actions:

```env
GRAPHOOD_SITE_LOAD_ENDPOINT=/documented/load/path
GRAPHOOD_SITE_DRAFT_ENDPOINT=/documented/draft/path
GRAPHOOD_SITE_PUBLISH_ENDPOINT=/documented/publish/path
```

The repository did not contain site-content endpoint contracts, so the route intentionally returns a configuration error until these paths are supplied rather than silently inventing an API contract.
